            <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
            <p>You’ll hear TSM chant in stadiums whether they’re playing or not. The most internationally recognizable team in North America is again the #1 seed from the region going into Worlds 2017. After a come-from-behind win in Game 4 of their NA LCS Finals series against Immortals, TSM became NA LCS Champions for the sixth time. They’ve competed in every NA LCS Championship Final, and this is their 7th World Championship, making them the only team in history to attend every World Championship.</p>

                Hauntzer is an MVP caliber player who can play any type of style -- passive or aggressive. Tanks or carries. He can do it all. While he mostly played it safe in his rookie year, Hauntzer on TSM has bloomed into a huge threat to carry from the top lane. In a league filled with star Korean top laners, Hauntzer has bested them all.
                His skills were on full display in the 2017 NA LCS Spring Finals against Cloud9, where he took on both Impact and Ray and earned Player of the Series honors. Now, as the NA LCS Champion, Hauntzer will be out for blood as he returns to the international stage.

                Svenskeren is an aggressive jungler who loves to duel opponents early and often. He’ll invade enemy camps given even the smallest openings. He struggled to find his footing initially after joining TSM in the spring of 2015, but since then he has almost singlehandedly ramped up the team's early-game aggression.
                Svenskeren captured the world’s attention when he styled on opponents as Lee Sin at the 2016 World Championship. While these performances didn’t ultimately carry TSM to success, expectations of him have nevertheless been raised as a result. Sporting his signature pedal-to-the-metal style, Svenskeren will return this year, bringing his momentum in full swing as he kicks, punches, and ganks his way through Worlds 2017.

                Bjergsen is consistently one of the west’s best players and will take his fourth straight shot at Worlds this year. The 2017 MVP, called the “North American Faker” by many, including the SK telecom T1 mid laner himself, Bjergsen has demonstrated he has no true equal among NA LCS mids. While Bjergsen and the rest of TSM have dominated North America, their international performances have left much to be desired.
                An early exit from TSM at the 2017 Mid-season Invitational meant NA won’t receive a one seed at Worlds. Now they’ll reap what they sowed. TSM is a different team now than it was at MSI, though. Bjergsen enters Worlds with another NA LCS MVP and Championship trophy added to his list of accomplishments. He may now be better equipped to deal with the tournament than ever.

                Past Worlds performances haunted Doublelift out of retirement. Newly motivated and hungry, this Worlds may see the most motivated Doublelift ever. It’s his record-tying fifth trip to the biggest stage, but he has yet to make it past the Group Stage.
                Widely considered one of the godfathers of modern ADCs, he’ll now try to play the part of the wily veteran. And unlike last year, he’s not tasked with mentoring a rookie support. If he and Biofrost can take their summer resurgence to the next level, then we may yet see shades of the old everyone-else-is-trash Doublelift.

                Biofrost has developed into a reliable support for TSM. A split away from Doublelift was probably a blessing for Biofrost, as it gave him more space to operate and discover his identity as a support player -- and not just as an extension of his AD Carry. On a team full of players looking to carry, it’ll be on him to temper their whims. When they all lean forward, he’ll need to lean back to balance the boat. On the international stage, proper vision will allow TSM to be more assertive, and it’ll be up to the Summer Finals MVP Biofrost to be their eyes.
